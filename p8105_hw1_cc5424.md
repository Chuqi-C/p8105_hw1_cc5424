This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

It includes variables including origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. There are important variables such as time_hour, temperature
(°C), humidity(%), wind_speed, wind_gust. It includes hourly data from
January 1, 2023, to January 15, 2023.

The mean temperature in the dataset is 39.58°C.

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

The x-axis represents time in hours. The y-axis represents temperature.
The color of each data point corresponds to its humidity value.

Temperature generally fluctuates upward over time. It peaks during
specific periods (near noon) and declines during evening hours. A
relationship exists between humidity and temperature, with lower
temperatures occurring at higher humidity levels.
